version GTN-1.04
Updated config version to 2.7
added Catch IronGolem
still unable to spawn from the spawn_egg

version GTN-1.05
Trying to add in special spawn_egg spawning for an IronGolem
The basic idea is stored in 2.6.2-GTN EggCatcherPlayerListener
I can now able to spawn an Iron Golem but refinement is needed.

Version GTN-1.06
Finished adding in special spawn egg spawning for all mob types
by adding EggNBT and processing in EggCatcherPlayerListener
