# EggCatcher-GTN-1.06
An Update for MC 1.9+ to version EggCatcher2.7

I tried to use this on spigot 1.10 and fell foul of a few problems.

1/ the economy failed with consol errors.

2/ payment could not use both item and vault costs together.

3/ players were unable to spawn in Iron Golems.

Changes:

Itemid's replaced with MATERIAL names.

Fixed the economy to access Vault correctly.

Re-arranged and rewrote the payment methods (itemCost, vaultCost or both can now be used)

Added Iron Golem.

Make it version 2.7
